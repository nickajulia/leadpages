				<p><span class="firstletter">Y</span>ou probably already understand the importance of career assessments. If not, check out the video presentation above to discover how the Career Insights &amp; Motivators Program can greatly improve your chances of job success.</p>
	
				<p>Our career assessments don’t simply ask you a few questions and provide you with a generic, re-hashed basic evaluation. </p>
	
				<p>No.</p>
	
				<p>Our state-of-the-art criteria will provide you a full breakdown of your personality traits, including suitable AND unsuitable job roles that match your personal circumstances.</p>
	
				<p>The reports focus on two core areas. The first is how you work. This studies how you interact in various work environments, including different forms of communication and interaction. The second area looks at why you work. This looks at your motivations to help others, to learn and to command and lead.</p>
	
				<p>These are of course, huge simplifications of the process, but they form the basis of the powerful evaluation criteria the reports look at. </p>
